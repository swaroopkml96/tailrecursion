    "Traditionally, deep learning has looked at data as a cloud of isolated points. Take for example ImageNet, a large dataset of 14 million images of everything from oranges and strawberries to people and street signs (important caveat: although ImageNet has transformed the field, it may be very [biased](https://excavating.ai/)). Each image is its own island with no relation to any other image, apart from the fact that they may contain the same kind of fruit, or the same traffic sign.\n",

Much of neuroscience has focused on the study of the types and functions of individual neurons. However most scholars today agree (with the possible exception of Penrose's Microtubules) that the answers to some of our deepest questions don't lie in some intricate property of neurons, but in the structure of the network as a whole."
